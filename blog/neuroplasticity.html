      <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
      <p>
        Understanding how ones brain works helps to improve how we develop and
        utilize it better. Realising that the brain can be molded and isn't
        fixed is great for learning new skills. This means that actively
        practicing new skills often is a great way to improve in that area. I'm
        going to implement the principles of neuroplasticity by believing in my
        ability to learn new skills. The key to this will be a constant flow of
        practicing these new skills, everyday that is possible. This will help
        make neural highways in my brain and turn me into a super duper
        developer. Along with this, doing the basics for my health will be
        essential. I'll continue to sleep, eat and exercise and complete my
        mindfulness to keep myself at peak performance. I found

      <h4>Growth mindset</h4>
      <p>
        The growth mindset is about seeing obstacles as an opportunity to better
        yourself instead of a bar you have to overcome. Challenges are a chance
        for growth in your life and not a pass/fail situation (which is the
        fixed mindset).What I found interesting about this topic was changing my
        approach of learning and applying skills to have the attitude of "not
        yet" instead of "I failed" or "I can't do this". Having a growth mindset
        means that you constantly look for challenges and are confident to face
        them head on and get stuck in. If you can't complete the challenge then
        you still imrpoved and learnt something, you didn't fail. Having a
        mindset like this helps people to improve and learn new concepts at a
        much faster rate. Having a growth mindset is often found in intelligent
        people as they are regularly challenging themselves and aren't afraid of
        failure. I found
        <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">this article</a> to be
        engaging on the subject of having a growth mindset.

    These concepts already have a place in my learning plan I believe.
    Practicing my skills and learning new ones often is something I'm striving
    for and is great for moulding my fluid brain. The growth mindset will take
    longer for me to fully embrace. I'm someone who has been scared of failure
    and this has pushed me in the past to work hard. Having a lighter approach
    to failure and trying to focus on the learning instead of the result will be
    a good shift, it might take a while to get there.
