    Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model that provides a Māori perspective on health.
    This was created by Tā Mason Durie in 1984. The model has 5 pillars which
    I'll go into more detail below and the activities I undergo that relate to
    each pillar
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p>
        Physical wellbeing is the one that is easiest to identify. How your body
        is feeling and moving is important even when you aren't doing physical
        activities. To help with this I'll be taking my dog for a walk every
        weekday and most weekend days to keep us both fit and active. I also
        ensure I always am in bed for at least 8 hours so I get a good amount of
        sleep and am ready for the day. My work on in this area is to try and
        eat healthier. It isn't easy when I'm at home all day, I tend to snack
        more than I should. I'll try and snack on healthier food items to keep
        my body well nourished.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p>
        I spend quality time with my family every morning before work/day care
        and every evening after everybody returns home. Often we'll play games
        and eat meals together. It is nice to spend time as a family and
        communicate about the different events going on in our lives. I don't
        have much time for those outside my immediate family but fit in the odd
        visit where I can if its practical.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p>
        This is the hardest pillar for me. Having a healthy mind is crucial to
        success. I have been trying to relax more and take pressure off myself.
        Having a young family has its pressures to provide and ensure they are
        happy and healthy. It's best to lead by example though so I try to be a
        calm and communicative person where I can. My daily walks are helpful in
        clearing my mind and putting me in a good mental state. I also complete
        deep breathing exercises when I am starting to feel overwhelmed. Mostly
        it's about overcoming my inner voice which is a battle still enraging.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p>
        I'm not a believer in spirituality. If it does exist I think it would
        come under mental and emotional wellbeing. Mindfulness is something I'm
        trying to implement for this.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h4>
      <p>
        When I'm outside walking the dog we walk through nature and waterways
        which makes me feel like a part of the natural order of things. If it
        wasn't winter I'd probably do some more sitting in the sun to improve my
        mental health and vitamin D intake.
