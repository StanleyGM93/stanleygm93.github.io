    As part of the foundations portion of the Dev academy program I've been
    revising my HTML and CSS skills. One of the tasks is to research one topic
    in particular so I've chosen the one below as it is the one I had to remind
    myself and do a little research on:
  </p>

  <h3>What does it mean to display inline vs inline-block?</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h4>Inline:</h4>
      <p>
        An element that is displayed inline follows the natural order of the
        document. They do not start on a new line and only take up the space
        required for their content. These elements won't create line breaks and
        can only add space to the left and right of the element. You can't add
        alter the height or top/bottom padding or margins.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Inline-block</h4>
      <p>
        An element that is displayed as inline-block has a portion of both the
        inline and block display properties. An inline-block element won't start
        on a new line and continues in the normal flow of the block element it
        is contained in. It can however have it's width and height altered,
        along with having padding and margins added on all four sides.

    </li>
  </ol>
