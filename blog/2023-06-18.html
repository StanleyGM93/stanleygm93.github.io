    In this blog post I'm recording a learning plan to help motivate me through
    the next few months of studying with Dev academy. My long temr goal from
    working with Dev academy is to switch careers into the technology sector. I
    haven't figured out in what exact capacity yet and I think it's impossible
    to know what my dream role is until I work in the tech sector and figure out
    what tasks I do and don't enjoy.

    I've always excelled in structured learning environments. I was a good
    student at school where lessons were structured and there was a specific
    concept to learn and practice each lesson. I stuggled more at university
    where learning was more on me as an individual. Finding the time to review
    concepts was difficult and I procrastinated. I don't procrastinate to the
    same degree anymore but have other priorities in my life which can be
    distracting and limit the amount of time I have to learn and practice new
    concepts. For me to succeed in coding I believe I have to practice new
    concepts to gain a better grasp. Skills that I want to develop whilst
    studying with Dev academy is commmunication. It's a skill that I feel I'll
    be trying to improve on for the rest of my life. Concise and effective
    communication are key to have a successful career as it allows you to work
    well in a team and have less errors from misunderstandings and oversight. I
    need to push myself to be more outgoing as I'm a reserved person and tend to
    sit back and wait for things to play out. Being more proactive is a skill
    I'd like to develop.

    The workload of the program is going to be a challenge. Finding the time to
    complete the necessary tasks with distractions at home is something I've
    been worring about for months. I tried to prepare myself as much as possible
    before enrolling in Dev academy so that I didn't have many new concepts to
    learn and could simply apply the skills I have on new projects with other
    students. I will try and manage my workload by being strict about my
    studying and my non-studying time. Having a clear line on this will
    hopefully allow me to switch on and off as needed. When I'm struggling with
    the workload I'll take a break from screens and get outside and do some
    exercise or spend time with my family depending on the timing. I'll try
    reach out to others in my homegroup/facilitator for support as needed. I've
    found when I'm overwhelmed witha problem that taking a break and letting my
    subconcious do it's thing helps immensely.

    When I need to seek help my first message will likely be to my homegroup to
    see if anyone else is struggling or can offer support. Working in others is
    great to get different views on how problems can be solved. My facilitator
    will be in this group so will be looped into these messages. I also have my
    partner and friends to lean on if its a stress issue and not a coding
    specific issue. I've also got friends who have careers in technology who I
    could ask for advice and options to help me.
  </p>

  <p>
    The facilitation team are available to help me if I need them. I expect that
    they are there as moral and emotional support and less for coding problem
    solving. Having someone there to turn to can be important when I'm
    struggling or feeling lost. It's great to ask them before going down rabbit
    holes to check whether it's worth it. The facilitators being available for
    guidance will be fantastic as we move further through the curriculum.

    I'll have block-out times in the morning and evening where I'll spend time
    with my family. Currently I awake before everyone and complete some house
    chores before spending time with my family. During the day I can focus on
    studying and can switch back into family mode when everybody gets home. When
    whanau go to bed I'll have more time to study depending on how my day went
    and how I'm feeling.
