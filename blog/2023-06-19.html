    Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to understand both your own
    feelings and emotions and that of others you interact with. Some of the
    skills that show emotional intelligence are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-awareness</li>
    <li>Self-regulation</li>
    <li>Motivation</li>
    <li>Empathy</li>
    <li>Communication</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Emotional intelligence (EQ) is different to IQ but both can be important. EQ
    refers to ones ability to understand yourself and those around you and not
    simply your academic ability. IQ measures a persons problem solving and
    logical skills. This can corelate with a persons academic ability and
    knowledge but not how successful they will be in life. Having a higher EQ
    can be a good indicator of successful people as they are able to work well
    with others and achieve their goals through a deeper understanding of
    themselves. Improving your EQ is a great way to increase your happiness,
    leadership skills and perception of others.
