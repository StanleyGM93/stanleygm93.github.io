  <h4>JavaScript</h4>
  <p>
    I've continued learning the basics of JavaScript. I've moved from variables onto:
  <ul>
    <li>Conditional statements</li>
    <li>Loops</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Objects</li>
  </ul>
  I've only scratched the surface on the possibilities and I need to continue to put my learnings into practice to
  cement the knowledge and begin to think like a developer.

  <h4>CSS Counters</h4>

  <p>I created a codepen using CSS counters. This progress trackers made use of CSS counters. Before this pen I was
    unaware that you could add content to a web page using CSS. There are only a limited number of reasons to do this
    instead of simply adding the content direcftly in the HTML document. These small learnings will add up to make me a
    better developer overall. </p>
