    It's been a while since I've updated this blog. I've been consistent with my learning still and have been exclusively working with React. I started with learning what JSX was (it's a JavaScript syntax extension). From there I learnt about class components and with the aid of a tutorial project, created the Jammming project which shows my skills in this. After that it came to functional components and React hooks. This seems much more streamlined and allows for less code writing to achieve the same goals as Class components. Learning all of these skills is helpful though as you never know what code you'll be asked to look at and refactor or make improvements on.

    Going forward I'll be finishing off my current project (Contact and appointment planner). This illustrates the new skills that I've acquired. It definetely hasn't been as straight forward as I thought it would be. Once that is done I'll try implement some testing as it's an important part of product development. I'll be trying to learn the React Testing Library and implementing that into my project and future projects. 
  </p>

  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  
  <p>After this project is considered complete I'll look into new projects to show off my skills. Every project is a good opportunity to implement the skills I think I know and identify areas that I need to relearn. Every day is a challenge but that's what makes this career path exciting!
