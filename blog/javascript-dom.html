    JavaScript is a programming language, unlike HTML and CSS. The difference is
    that a programming language adds interactiveity to websites. It allows you
    to change styles, add text, alter images and play games to name a few. HTML
    provides the content and structure of a website, CSS the decoration and
    JavaScript the interaction.

    Programming languages (such as JavaScript) include many of the same features
    across them. Some common features include control flow and loops. Control
    flow is a common concept, it uses <code>if</code> and
    <code>else</code> statements. An easy example is a light switch, if the
    switch is down the light turns on, if it's up then the light is off. This
    idea is used in JavaScript as you can write code that will only run in
    certain situations. Loops seem like an easy idea but take a while to get
    your head around. There are a few different ways to set up a loop but
    basically a loop will execute a piece of code repeatedly. It will either run
    until a condition is met or however many times you tell it to run. Loops are
    great, it gives you the power to run through large lists (arrays or sets as
    examples) quickly without having to copy and paste the same piece of code
    multiple times. Being able to execute a piece of code hundreds or thousands
    of time saves an enormous amount of time for the programmer.

    The document object model (DOM) is a model of the objects that make up the
    document. Every element and attribute make up nodes that can be accessed
    using JavaScript. This allows for the website to become interactive as we
    can use JavaScript to change these nodes to add content, remove content,
    change styles or any other interaction a programmer can think of.

    Arrays are a list of different data points which can be accessed using an
    index in square brackets such as: <code>Array[0]</code>. JavaScript starts
    counting arrays at index 0. This means that <code>Array[0]</code> will
    return the first point in the array. Objects can be accessed by using keys.
    All objects have keys and values, these can vary considerably but there are
    standard ways to access information in objects. To obtain the keys of the
    object you are able to use the function
    <code>Object.keys(exampleObject)</code>. A similar function exists for
    finding the values of an object: <code>Object.values(exampleObject)</code>.
    Below is an example of an object:

  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  <pre>
    const person = { 
      name: "John Doe", 
      age: 30,
      profession: "Software Developer", 
      hobbies: ["reading", "playing guitar", "running"], 
      address: { street: "123 Main St", city: "Exampleville", country: "Exampleland" },
    };
  </pre>

  <p>
    To access the name of the person you could write either
    <code>person.name</code> or <code>person[name]</code>, both would return
    "John Doe".
  </p>

    Functions are a chunk of code that usually perform a specific task. The more
    specific a function is the easier a large amount of code is to understand.
    Functions store a set of instructions that will be executed when called
    upon. These sets of instructions can be as simple as changing some text to
    changing the full layout of the page. Being able to store these sets of
    instructions is great as they are only used when required but can be called
    upon as many times as required.
