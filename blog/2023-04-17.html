    It's been a long time between the previous blog post and this one. I've been
    focusing on the Codecademy syllabus and have made grat strides in this. At
    the beginning of the back-end development section of this I learnt about
    NodeJS. I made a project using NodeJS which is called finding your hat. This
    can be found in my Github profile. I only learnt the basics of Node so I'm
    hoping to further develop my knowledge in this area as it is a powerful
    tool.
