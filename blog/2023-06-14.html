    During this week I've completed the first sprint for the foundations portion
    of the <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">Dev Academy</a> curriculum. In
    this sprint we covered the command line, git and GitHub. I feel that I have
    a good understanding of these topics and hence it was mostly revision for
    me. I did learn about the command <code>git diff</code> which I hadn't heard
    of before. It's handy for when you take a break and return and aren't sure
    what files have been changed and what changes have been made. This is also
    the engine that runs the <code>git log</code> command too. I enjoyed
    learning about <code>git log</code> as I have needed to run it in the past
    for projects where I've made breaking changes and needed to restore to a
    previous version of my code.

    In the coming weeks I'll try to improve the styling on this personal website
    as I've been procrastinating it for a long time. I'll seek feedback on what
    could be improved and try to implement those changes.
