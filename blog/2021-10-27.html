    Although my skills in CSS are getting better slowly, I still have a lot to learn. The latest area of focus is on CSS selectors. Being able to use selectors efficiently will save on time when writing code and also make it easier for other developers to understand what rules are being applied to different elements on the site. Having to override styles on specific elements can be an easier way to write code on the initial draft but can be slower if you need to add classes and id's to elements to specify them specifically instead of using CSS selectors that can do the job.

  <h4>Padding: left; vs Padding: inline-start</h4>
    <p>
      I began writing my CSS and using the left/right values for padding and margins etc. I was dutyfully informed that users that read right to left or top down will not be able to easily understand the web page if it is translated for them. This is why the inline and box start and end values are far superior and should be used. Learning how to make webpages more accessible to all is beneficial as you are able to reach the widest viewership.
