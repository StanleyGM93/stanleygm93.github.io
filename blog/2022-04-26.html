    I've completed my introduction to JavaScript learnings. I've enrolled on an online full-stack engineer course to help align all the different areas that I've been studying. This will hopefully help drive me towards a new career. This has meant that I've reviewed many of the HTML and CSS concepts that I'd learnt previously which has helped cement the knowledge and remind me of areas of weakness.

  <h4>Extra Learnings</h4>

    I'll continue to test my CSS skills as I feel like it could be a differentiating skill to help me stand out. Being able to code webpages from designs is a skill I'd like to advance in. It is fun, similar to putting a jigsaw puzzle together. I'd also like to learn liquid or another HTML framework as it will be essential to know for most workplaces. It will save many hours of coding if I'm able to use it for large scale sites.
