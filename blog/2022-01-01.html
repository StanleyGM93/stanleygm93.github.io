  <h4>Goals for 2022</h4>
  <p>
    Since it is the beginning of the new year I figured I would set some goals. I'm not a hge fan of setting goals in general as I tend to forget about them. Goal setting is a skill in itself as the goals have to be achievable, yet be challenging and not too easily to complete. After some thought I've decided on the following goals:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Improve in my HTML5 knowledge so that the HTML I write is semantic and makes logical sense on it's own.</li>
    <li>Work on my CSS knowledge so that I better understand more complex CSS workings. This may include the use of flexbox, grid and psuedo-classes.</li>
    <li>Have a solid understanding of SASS as it is one of the most important CSS dependancies. In the same light I'd like to have a working understanding of Bootstrap and  Tailwind as they are commonly used by frontend developers.</li>
    <li>To understand git at an intermediate level so that I'm confident when using the terminal and can perform merges, make new directories and complete other tasks that git is regularly used for.</li>
    <li>If I'm able I'd like to contribute to a group project in some capacity. I'm picturing I'd help with an open source project to help learn new skills but more importantly, build new relationships within the sector and learn form others on how I can improve. This is easily the most exciting of my goals so I'm hopeful I'll be able to start applying my skills to live projects by the end of 2022.</li>
  </ol>

 <p>I'll review my progress towards these goals halfway through the year but I feel it is a good benchmark as to what I think I can achieve in a year. <em>Happy Holidays!</em></p>
