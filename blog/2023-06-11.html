  <p>
    In the coming weeks I'll be undertaking a course that is run by
    <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">Dev Academy</a>. In this course I'm
    hoping to learn new skills that will make me a more desirable candidate to
    hire. Some of these skills are technical but I'm most looking forward to
    completing interesting projects with others in both a partner and a team
    setting. Learning how to work in an agile environment will be beneficial and
    learning from industry professionals is invaluable.

    The human skills component will be of higher value to me than the coding
    part of the course. I believe I have good fundamentals in coding but being
    able to articulate and communicate effectively are crucial skills to have if
    I want to work in the technology sector. I'm looking forward to the
    challenge and hope to emerge a well rounded individual and developer.
