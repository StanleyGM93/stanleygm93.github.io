    As part of the Dev academy curriculum I'm working on my interpersonal and
    intrapersonal skills. The first step in this process is to identify my core
    values along with my strengths and weaknesses. I feel that I've done quite a
    bit of this type of learning in the past through various experiences. I've
    had to think about these things in sporting, professinal and hobbiest
    settings. It's good to reflect on my values every so often because they are
    likely to change as I get older and my prioreties change. Below are some
    examples of my identity, values, strengths and weaknesses with accompying
    examples.

      <h4>Ethical decision</h4>
      <p>
        I initially struggled to think of an ethical decision that I had to
        make. Upon some research into ethical decisions I realised that my
        decision to change to a vegetarian diet could be considerd an ethical
        decision. I've been following a vegetarian diet for over 3 years now
        (with the exception of when Cyclone Gabrielle hit our region). I decided
        to become a vegetarian as scientific research suggests that has a lower
        impact on our environment. Most sources of meat require a vast amount of
        land and water to produce food compared to plant foods. The case for
        animal cruelty does have a small impact on my decision making but the
        environment was the main factor in my decision. It hasn't always been
        easy following the diet as I am the only one in my household. I still
        believe in my decision however and do not regret it.

      <h4>Culture</h4>
      <p>
        I grew up in ahouse where hard work was heavily emphasised. The culture
        around me was to be kind and polite but to work hard for the goals you
        are trying to achieve. I was encouraged to do well academically and
        enjoy the sports I participated in. The people around me have always
        provided me with sound advice on future steps and areas that I'm strong
        in. I have a laid back personality so I meld well into team
        environments. Although I'm not outspoken I do think about what I say
        before I say it. I value friendship and teamwork and believe in
        comprimises in most situations and that common ground can usually be
        found to difficult situations.

      <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Logical - I've always done well in logical subject areas such as math.
          That's how I managed to do well in my university degree as accounting
          and chemistry are both logical subjects where if you think things
          through you are able to come to solutions. I believe this will help
          with coding as being logical means I work my way through problems in a
          methodical way which will help me learn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborative - I tend to fit into most teams easily. I'm not very
          outspoken but I like to observe and insert myself where I'm required.
          I don't mind doing the hard or ifficult jobs that others don't want to
          do for the benefit of the team. This is one of the reasons I'm looking
          forward to bootcamp because it will be great to work with others and
          be able to help each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Empathy - I believe that I am a compassionate person who can
          understand and try to relate to others who are having a difficult
          time. This allows me to build strong relationships with others as we
          can quickly develop a strong level of trust. I can be relied on to not
          judge others unfairly for their situations and can help work through
          the problems facing them when appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Self-motivation - I have the drive to push myself to new heights and
          achieve my goals. I've been coding mostly on my own for close to 2
          years now with the goal of transtitioning to a new career. This has
          meant investing in myself financially which isn't easy given I have to
          help support a young family. It also has required me to find time to
          learn, which has meant early mornings and late nights. All of this to
          try achieve my goal and live the life I want.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <p>
        I like to follow a very structured learning approach to new concepts. In
        environments where there is less structure I can get a bit lost. I enjoy
        structure and routine which give me confidence, if I get taken out of my
        routine I can get a little uncomfortable but that is important on
        occasions to change things up. I'm not a creative person and this limits
        me in some areas of coding. I don't believe I can make a great UI from
        scratch without using another design or following some mark-up on Figma
        etc. Bootcamp will push me out of my comfort zone and force me to trink
        creatively to find solutions and I look forward to try and improve
        myself in this area.
      </p>

      <h4>Conflict resolution</h4>
      <p>
        When setting up research trials there are usually different opinions on
        the best way to set up the trial. This usually includes when to pick and
        store the produce. The optimal way to do this is sometimes up for
        discussion both within the team and between external stakeholders in the
        research. The most common approach I take is to explain my reasoning
        about the approach we should take and to listen to others and their
        opinions/concerns. This approach is often effective as stakeholders are
        able to air their concerns and often they mention details I had failed
        to think about. Having different voices is great to ensure nothing is
        left to chance and all bases are covered. When this doesn't work is when
        two or more people can't agree on the best path forward. Other
        strategies that could be tried include conflict resolution with those
        involved. Alternatively clarifying roles and responsibilties can help as
        those with more experience and knowledge in the topic should have more
        weight put on their thoughts. The most important thing to me is that the
        conflict is dealt with in a positive manner. Having a positive team
        culture ensures that the only issue is the approach to the problem and
        not dealing with interpersonal conflicts.
