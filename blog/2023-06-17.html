    As part of the Dev academy curriculum I'm working on my interpersonal and
    intrapersonal skills. The first step in this process is to identify my core
    values along with my strengths and weaknesses. I feel that I've done quite a
    bit of this type of learning in the past through various experiences. I've
    had to think about these things in sporting, professinal and hobbiest
    settings. It's good to reflect on my values every so often because they are
    likely to change as I get older and my prioreties change. Below are some
    examples of my identity, values, strengths and weaknesses with accompying
    examples.

      <h4>Ethical decision</h4>
      <p>
        I initially struggled to think of an ethical decision that I had to
        make. Upon some research into ethical decisions I realised that my
        decision to change to a vegetarian diet could be considerd an ethical
        decision. I've been following a vegetarian diet for over 3 years now
        (with the exception of when Cyclone Gabrielle hit our region). I decided
        to become a vegetarian as scientific research suggests that has a lower
        impact on our environment. Most sources of meat require a vast amount of
        land and water to produce food compared to plant foods. The case for
        animal cruelty does have a small impact on my decision making but the
        environment was the main factor in my decision. It hasn't always been
        easy following the diet as I am the only one in my household. I still
        believe in my decision however and do not regret it.
