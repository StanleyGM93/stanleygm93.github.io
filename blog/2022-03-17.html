  <h4>CLI, Git and GitHub</h4>
  <p>
    Over the previous couple of weeks I've been working on my knowledge of the command line interface (CLI). This felt
    like an essential skill to learn for me, along with being one of my 5 goals for the year as a beginner web
    developer. Being abnle to navigate through directories and perform basic tasks will serve me well in the future. As
    I move into bigger projects my knowledge in this area will save me many headaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the CLI I moved into improving my skills in Git and GitHub. I had a basic understanding but learning about more
    specific tasks such as rebasing and cloning repositories will be essential when I try to find a new job in this
    industry. I learnt about pull requests and best practices for commits and communication. These things will add up to
    make me a more desirable candidate and make me more competent developer that others may be willing to work with.
  </p>

  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  <p>
    From here I have many options available. Some of these are:
  <ul>
    <li>Style my home on the web</li>
    <li>Continue trying to create common UI designs in CodePen</li>
    <li>Return to trying to learn JavaScript</li>
  </ul>

  All of these are good options. Luckily I can do them all concurrently. Styling my home on the web (my personal
  project) will be a job for when I have a large amount of time. The other options I can chip away at in my spare time.
