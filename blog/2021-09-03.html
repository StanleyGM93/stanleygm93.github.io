    I've been working on my CSS skills by styling my personal web page. This has been challenging as I don't have great
    designing skills
    and my abilities in CSS are limited at this point. I've signed up to Figma to try and help me with this as it can
    create static webpages to show off designs.

  <p>
    I took up a challenge on Github to create a webpage based on a design and content. The goal is to develop the page
    to be identical
    to the example with a responsive UI. It is my first project using html and CSS. I've struggled with the alignment of
    certain elements.
    My CSS skills need to be worked on ti imprive the way I can style webpages. Once I improve in my HTML and CSS I'll
    look to
    contribute to open source projects where possible to improve in my skills and collaborate with others.

  <p>
    My biggest weakness at this point is my understanding of the syntax. My ability to understand and communicate what
    I'm thinking and the
    issues I'm faced with can be improved. This will help when I'm faced with an issue and forced to search for
    solutions.
    I'll improve on this in time if I remain persistent as it's important I use the corrent language with others so that
    I'm understood.
