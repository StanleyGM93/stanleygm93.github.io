  <h4>Command Line Interface</h4>
  <p>
    During the week I purchased a cryptocurrency called Helium (HNT). This crypto doesn't have a traditional software wallet available to store the crypto securely. Instead it uses a command line interface (CLI) which I had never heard of before. It would have definately been outside of my skill set a few months ago when I began this journey. With my limited experience in using a terminal (git bash in my case) I was able to follow the documentation and get the HNT transferred to the wallet and confirm the updated balance. This illustrated to me that the skills I'm learning go beyond simple development of webpages. These skills have other purposes and have helped me to understand technology a bit better. Following documentation is something that I'm slowly picking up and improving on. This small exercise was a massive win to me as it was a real world example of how to follow documentation. It's a simple list of instructions I know but it's the little things that add up to larger victories.
