  <h4>JavaScript and React</h4>

  <p>
    I've come to the point where I've learnt many of the core concepts of JavaScript. I'm sure there are many that I still haven't learnt but for an intermediate understanding I think I'm in a good place. Some of these concepts that I've learnt about are: 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>Fetch requests</li>
    <li>Promises</li>
    <li>Async and await</li>
    <li>The Event loop</li>
    <li>Modular programming with import/export</li>
    <li>Testing using Mocha</li>
    <li>JSON and using API's</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Obviously I still have to practice these concepts to keep them cemented in my mind and can demonstrate my knowledge to others with a project. I also learnt about HTTP requests and the responses expected from servers. From here I'm moving into React which will be another large stepping stone in this journey.</p>
