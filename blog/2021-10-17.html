  <h4>Git merge</h4>
  <p>
    Today I completed my first merge using Git. I had previously made a branch from the main branch in Git so that I
    could try and implement Jekyll tempating into these static web pages. I had been running the two branches in
    parallel as I was implementing Jekyll on the side branch and adding new posts to my blog on the main branch. The
    merge went better than expected with only a handful of conflicts to resolve. Once the branches were merged I simply
    had to update the two previous blog posts to the new Jekyll template format and the pages were all updated and
    operational.

  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  <p>
    I am continuing my CSS learnings and will soon start to style my home on the web so that it is much more appealing
    for readers and easier to navigate. I am also nearly finished with my UI coding challenge which is stored in a
    seperate repository. The more practice with CSS I can get the better which is my current objective. I like to
    remember the following from Lao Tzu the ancient Chineese philospher,
    <q cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/lao_tzu_137141">the journey of a thousand miles begins with a one
      step</q>.
