    This blog post is covering my learnings on the human skills portion of the
    course so far. Throughout foundations we've covered a large body of work in
    this space and I'm now reflecting on what I think of it and any knowledge,
    insight or skills I've gained.
  </p>

  <p>Three new things that I've learnt about myself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed Mindset - I feel that I've always had a fixed mindset and not a
      growth mindset. This meant that I ways excelled in the subjects I thought
      I was born to be good at and not very skilled at others. I was always
      scared of failing and so I never tried to learn to many new concepts that
      I thoguht I wouldn't succeed in.
    </li>
    <li>
      Self doubt - I still have a voice in my head that tells me I can't do it.
      As I've aged I've tried to put this to the back of my mind and fill my
      thoughts with positive ones. With this change I'm hoping to become much
      more succesful.
    </li>
    <li>
      EQ and IQ - I would guess that I have an above average IQ (could well be
      wrong here...). My emotional intelligence will always need word however.
      I'm an introverted person and don't communicate many of my feelings with
      others. Being able to empathise and understand others will take me a long
      way in both personal and professional environments.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To suceced in learning and programming it is helpful to understand your own
    values, have empathy for yourself and others and have self-awareness. Your
    values help to establish what motivates you as a person, understanding this
    will push you to areas in life you want to excel in. Having empathy helps
    you to connect with others and work with them which is crucial in group work
    as very little is achieved alone. Self-awareness is understanding how your
    mind works, the state of your physical and mental health and combining it
    all. Being self aware allows you to rest when your tired and understand why
    some concepts are easier than others. Being able to understand yourself is
    key to getting the best out of yourself.

    The most surprising aspect of core learning for me was growth mindset. It
    seems obvious looking back now but it's incredible how much difference a
    mindset shift can make. Learning about it was fun and I'm trying to
    implement a growth mindset into my life and into those close to me. The most
    challenging part of core learning was my inner voice and self doubt. I still
    work on this and try and have a positive frame of mind when tackling
    problems but it still creeps in.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a programming school it could be easy to focus on the technical learning
    and ignore the human skills. They are important to learn as having a
    successful career in any industry requires utilising these human skills.
    Without a strong basis of communication, integrity and other skills you will
    not be able to have a succussful career. I have frequently heard that you
    can teach to skills to someone with a great attitude and good human skills,
    it's much harder to teach human skills to somebody with strong technical
    skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    I feel that most of my time learning core skills has been a waste. Apart
    from the growth mindset concept I've not learnt anything new. I have done
    core learnings for so long through voluntering in the community, sports and
    in the professional arena that I have become a bit bored of them. I know
    that I still have to work on them and take an intraspective approach but I
    didn't need a programming school to do this with me. I'd argue that my blog
    posts have had a bigger benefit to the facilitator who reads them to
    understand me better than me writing them.
