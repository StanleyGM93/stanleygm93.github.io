  <h4>Flexbox and Grid</h4>
  <p>
    I've begun to learn all about flexbox and grid. Their ability to easily organise different elements and their
    children is a real asset. Understanding how they work and being able to use them efficiently will safe me a large
    amount of time when writing CSS. The main difference is that flexbox is aimed to be used as a one-dimensional tool
    whereas grid is a two-dimensional tool. Flexbox is great at organising the parent container and its children in a
    single line whereas grid is a for organising a parent and its children across the main and cross axis.

  <h4>Transitions</h4>
  <p>
    Transitions are a way to make a webpage stand out. Their ability to alter how certain items change after being
    hovered or altered in any way is great. As a developer I'm able to control the element(s) that transition. The
    transitions can all be controlled via a single declaration:
  <pre><code>transition: property duration timing-function delay</code></pre>
  These are the basics for animations which can be built upon when I begin including them in regular developments.
  </p>

  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  <p>
    I'll continue to learn about more CSS so that I move into having a more intermediate understanding to help me develop more complex webpages. I've also got to revisit the box model so that my basics are solid. If I can nail that then it will save me a large amount of time when styling basic components during development.
