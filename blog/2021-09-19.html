    I've begun a UI coding challenge to try and improve my HTML and CSS skills. CSS fundamentals are getting difficult
    but it's enjoyable to play around
    with different settings to see how things interact. CSS feels like a jigsaw puzzle, in that you have a design you
    are trying to copy and you write
    code to see how you can fit all the pieces together nicely to build the design.

    I was informed of another interesting organisation that specialises in CSS and making all websites accessable to
    all. Often certain headings need to be added in HTML
    for the website to make sense to a screen reader. These are often marked up as
  <pre><code>display:none;</code></pre> in CSS which means that they are not recognised
  by the screen reader. The A11y (accessability) project is all about allowing anyone to have access to the web. They
  suggest using the following code to change certain
  elements so that they aren't seen by the average user but are recognised by the screen reader:
  <pre><code>.visually-hidden {
                    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
                    clip-path: inset(50%);
                    height: 1px;
                    overflow: hidden;
                    position: absolute;
                    white-space: nowrap;
                    width: 1px;
                  }</code></pre>
  A link to their website is in the useful links section.
