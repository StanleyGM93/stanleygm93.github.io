    I took a quiz to check how many HTML5 elements I could name in 10 minutes. Of the 110 I could name 51 with some
    help.
    I'll look to improve on this in the future. The quiz is slightly outdated with some old element names and new ones
    that aren't included.
    I've begun learning a little CSS and will endeavour to improve on this and integrate it into my HTML.

    I have also been shown a HTML5 validator that I can run my code through to check for any errors.
    This will allow me to self-improve how I write code and ensure it is compatible with browsers.
    A link to the validator is in the useful links list.
