  <h4>Sass Learnings</h4>
  <p>
   Learning Sass has been an interesting journey so far. It began by learning that you can include variables that would help to reduce the amount of repitition occuring whilst styling. This then grew to an understanding of mixins and placeholders that can be used throughout the styles of the pages. I then learnt about iterating through lists/maps with each loops and for/while loops. This, along with functions adds yet another dimension to the possibilities of using Sass. I feel like they will complement Javascript when I begin relearning this. I can imagine that on large projects the ability to use Sass will save on hours of styling and can reduce the amount of Javascript and coding in general required.

  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  <p>
    I'm going back to CSS to try and finish off my basic learnings. In particular I'm going to try and learn more about flex and grid layouts. Along with this I'd like to gain a deeper understanding of CSS units. By that I mean the difference between em and rem, viewport height and width (compared to percentages) along with other units that I'm probably not aware of.
