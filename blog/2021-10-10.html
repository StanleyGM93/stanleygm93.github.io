    There's been a break from updating this blog. Finding the time to make meaningful progress has been difficult in the
    last couple of weeks.
    Learning CSS remains my main focus of study. HTML5 is a relatively logical language to use which suits the way that
    my brain works. CSS is more difficult for me
    as what you expect to be the final result isn't often what actually occurs in my experience. With practice I'll
    improve and hopefully I'll get to the stage
    where I can replicate most website designs. Finding good practice on this is hard at this stage and I'll look to see
    how I can put my CSS lessons to use
    so that I can improve on my flaws and fill knowledge gaps.
