    The DOM was a concept that I was introduced to after learning the basics of JavaScript. It essentially is a model that enables developers to interact with webpages through it's nodes (objects). Every element, class, attribute etc are nodes that are able to be accessed and modified via a programing language (in this case JavaScript). Learning how to utilise this allows developers to add interactivity to webpages to add to the user experience and complete more in-depth tasks.

  <h4>Form validation</h4>

  <p>
    Client side validation of forms was an area of focus that I reviewed. Ensuring that users can only input data that is valid is essential. It allows databases to have accurate information and prevents issues that may occur down the line. Client side validation is an efficient way to check the inputs before the data is sent to the server where is is checked again. It's faster to validate before the data is sent but this can be overridden which is why server-side validation is essential
