  <h4>Progress check on goals</h4>

  <p>
    I made goals at the beginning of 2022 to help motivate me. Since it is halfway through the year I'm looking back to see what progress I've made and whether the goals are still achievable, realistic or have been achieved. 
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h4>Improve at HTML</h4>
      <p>At the beginning of the year I made good progress towards this goal. I've practiced writing forms that are semantic and easy for a user to use. I think I've made good progress towards this goal. Before the end of the year I should revise HTML elements and common attributes to retain my knowledge</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Understand CSS flex-box, grid and pseudo-classes</h4>
      <p>I think I have achieved this goal. Early in the year I did a lot of work on flex-box and grid to understand how they work. I've applied this knowledge in a couple of side projects which are on GitHub. I found games on these topics online which were fun to play and helped practice thse skills. Pseudo-classes are a step above this but I believe I have a good understanding of how they work and when it is appropriate to implement them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Understand SASS, Bootstrap or Tailwind</h4>
      <p>I've made no progress towards this goal. I've moved away from UI/UX in my learning and am learning JavaScript currently. I may come back to this in the second half of the year but may choose to progress further in my JavaScript learnings and move into React instead.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Use git proficiently</h4>
      <p>I've learnt how to use git and have improved at understanding errors and how to google these. I've cloned a few projects and used git which has helped to build my confidence. It is something I'll return to later in the year to revise as it is an essential skill to be hired.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Contribute to a group project</h4>
      <p>No progress on this so far. I'm simply trying to learn as much as I can and implement what I know. If this were to happen it would likely be at the end of the year. I need to finish off projects I'm currently working on such as this blog first before I consider a group project.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
