  <h4>Sass</h4>
  <p>
    While learning about CSS and and it's libraries (Bootstrap specifically) I've come accross Sass. Sass is a CSS pre-processor. It allows the developer to define variables that are able to be reused throughout the stylesheets along with other cool features. A developer can use Sass to increase the power of CSS and reduce the amount of code required compared to writing the styling in CSS alone. I'm hoping to learn more about Sass and begin to start implementing it in my projects to help me master it.

  <h4>Dependencies</h4>
  <p>
    While installing Sass for my UI-coding-challenge project I learnt more about dependencies and how to get them running on my local machine. This is done using Node.js which I still have a lot to learn about. By eventually having more projects and reading documentation I hope to learn how this works and the correct way to run dependencies on my projects.
