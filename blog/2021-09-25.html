  <h4>Jekyll</h4>
  <p>
    In writing my previous blog post I became bothered at how long it took me to update all the links in the nav. Not
    only did I have to write the blog post and
    update the navigation on that page, I also had to update the navigation on all other blog posts (6+ posts). To
    combat this I created a seperate branch from
    the main branch in git. This is the "jekyll-template" branch where jekyll was set up and used. Jekyll is a static
    templating package that allows the user
    to recreate a static page from a template that can be repeated multiple times. This is great for my blog posting as
    the template will include the navigation and
    all other information that is the same across all the blog posts (such as the useful links section). This means I
    only have to update the single navigation
    page when writing a new blog post and there is much less copy and pasting occuring. In the coming days I will merge
    the main and jekyll-template branches together.
    For anyone interested in how I got jekyll established on my personal blog they can read the README.md file in this
    repository.

  <h4>Git</h4>
  <p>
    I improved on my skills using git this week as I managed to create a new branch using git and then add this to my
    online github repository as well.
    I've learnt how to check the different branches that currently exist using the
  <pre><code>git branch</code></pre> command. I learnt how to switch between these when required as well. These are only
  minor skills to learn but essential to my development. My favourite trick I learnt in the last week is that I can open
  anything I'm developing in VScode by opening the branch in git and using the command
  <pre><code>code .</code></pre> This will open VScode and all the files in the branch.
