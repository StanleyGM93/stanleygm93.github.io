  <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
  <p>
  I've read many posts online from developers that use Bootstrap to style their work. I thought I would look into it to compliment my knowledge of CSS and add another skill to my belt. Bootstrap is a framework that helps users style their sites by adding keywords to classes of html elements that style those elements. I'm trying to recreate my UI coding challenge with Bootstrap to help me understand how it works. So far the index.html document gets congested with the addition of so many <code>div</code> elements and classes. Learning the basics of Bootstrap will hopefully give me a different perspective on how to develop code and will help me understand other developers work that use bootstrap.
