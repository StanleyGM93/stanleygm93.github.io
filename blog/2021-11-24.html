  <h4>First time using a checkbox</h4>
  <p>
    I was working on the UI coding challenge which is stored in my Github repo. The main navigation bar was wide which
    made it awkward when being viewed with a narrow screen such as a mobile one. It was decided to use a menu button
    that would show or hide the menu when pushed (only in use with small screens). To do this a menu button was created
    using the <em>label</em> element. The checkbox was then inserted to the webpage. A link was established between the
    checkbox and the button using CSS so that when the button was clicked the main menu would appear or disappear. I
    didn't know this was possible using simple HTML and CSS. It has opened my eyes to the possibilities without using
    other languages such as Javascript. I even had help making a transitional effect (similar to those seen in microsoft
    powerpoint). I can now apply what I've learnt to my own personal website.
