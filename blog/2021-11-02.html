  <h4>Media Queries</h4>
  <p>
    Over the weekend I was introduced to media queries in CSS. This was a large revelation to me as of it's widespread usage. It can be used to alter the styles of a webpage based on the size of the screen viewing the content. It allows the developer to change the styles for different situations without having to rewrite all of the styles from scratch. It explained to me how dark mode works on webpages. I thought that there might be two sets of CSS files with one set for light mode and one for dark. Using media queries enabled dark modes to be possible with much less effort required by the developer. There is a wide range of uses for media queries that I'll start to get into in the coming weeks. Small progress but any progress is great to have.
