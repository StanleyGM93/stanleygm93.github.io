  <h4>Redux</h4>

  <p>
 I've completed the redux component of the codecademy full-stack engineering course. As part of this I learnt aboiut the flux architecture behind the purpose of redux which is to have a simpler way of updating the state of an app. Redux creates a circular, one way system to manage the state of an app. The three steps in this are: 
  </p>

  <p>
    Action -> State -> View
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Having a method of tracking and updating an app's state can make it easier to have seperate areas of an app interact with each other. It solves the issue of having to pass props all other the place across React apps. I learn the basics of Redux, how you can implement this with react (React redux). I then learnt about react toolbox which simplifies the syntax requried. I completed the Flashcards project found on my Github repository. Redux is a great tool but the project has to be large enough to warrant using redux as there are other state management frameworks out there which I'll investigate. 
  </p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>
  I've started to learn Node.js which will be an interesting test for me. It's the first time for me learning some backend specific languages and frameworks. I'm excited to see how the front-end and back-end communicate and what the scope of a full-stack developer encompasses.
