  <h4>JavaScript Progression</h4>

  <p>
    It's been a month since my last blog update. In that time I've been following the Codecademy course. After completing the Introduction to JavaScript course I've been solving challenges. These included the use of loops, arrays and objects. The challenges have helped to cement my JavaScript knowledge but more importantly given me confidence that I can solve these problems with enough time. It is a rewarding feeling when the solution you derive works correctly.

  <h4>Side Projects</h4>

  <p>
    I have also been working on a couple of projects which are stored in repositories on GitHub. The Tea Cozy project was a project designed to implement flexbox on a design given to me. After completing the initial design I've slowly been going through the project again to improve both the HTML and CSS so that it is cleaner and makes sense semantically.
