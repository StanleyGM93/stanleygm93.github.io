    I've begun my journey with basic html. I understand the basics of using tags to help develop a
    webpage.
    I understand how to build a basic webpage with a title, header and body.
    I've made webpages that include lists, tables and images with links.
    The jargon of html is still a work in progress. I struggle with explaining the difference between
    attributes, tags etc.
    Once I have a good understanding of html I'll slowly move onto learning CSS.
