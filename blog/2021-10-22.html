    Although in the previous blog post I commented that everything was <q>operational</q>, this was not the case. I failed to realise that my CSS styling folder wasn't being recognised. This meant that none of my styling was apparent on the webpages. After some investigating I worked out that the <code>_site</code> folder that is a duplicate of my files for Jekyll only had the site stylesheet and none of the others. I tried to build this again and again hoping that the build would update the <code>_site</code>_site folder to include my stylesheets. This failed and so I turned to Google. After 30 minutes of searching I couldn't find a solution to my issue. From there I reread the documentation multiple times to try and work out how to solve my issue. After spending hours trying to solve the issue an idea finally came to me. I thought the issue might be that my stylesheets were named with an underscore at the beginning and that was reserved for Jekyll folders only. Once I renamed my stylesheets to remove the underscore all of my issues were resolved. A good lesson here was to check that everything was working properly post-merge. It was a good lesson in debugging and problem solving which is an area I need to improve in.
