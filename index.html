                Hello my name is Stanley. This is the first full webpage that I am making in my journey to becoming
                a
                developer.
                I finished high school top of my class and went on to study at Victoria Univerisity of Wellington.
                I studied there for four years after which I came out with a conjoint Bachelor of Science and
                Bachelor
                of Commerce.
                I majored in <strong>Chemistry</strong> and <strong>Accounting</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first job was at a company that produced biological products and made pharmaceuticals for other
                companies.
                I was a senior labratory/production technician in my time there and worked in a team to produce
                vaccines
                for vetiranary use.
                The next and current role is as a research associate at Plant and Food Research.
                I am in the Quality and Storage Insights team where we test and optamise storage of fruits and
                vegetables along with other types of research and commercial contract work.
